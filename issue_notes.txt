
# Some Notes on What Can be Improved for Future

- Have a dedicated machine for the webserver.
Currently, the machine is being shared with another course offering, which means
that we do not get a standard port.

- Have more GPU instances.
Especially on sundays and just before the due date.

- Setup a propper issue tracker.

- Do not schedule the course when people have other commitments.
Not during finals and not during holidays.
