### MP1: Vector Addition

#### Objective

The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with using the CUDA API by implementing a simple vector addition kernel and its associated setup code.

#### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, make sure that:

* You can have completed lecture 2 video

* You have completed MP 0

* You have looked over the [help](/help) document.

* Chapter 3 of the text book would also be helpful

#### Instruction

Edit the code in the code tab to perform the following:

* Allocate device memory

* Copy host memory to device

* Initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions

* Invoke CUDA kernel

* Copy results from device to host

* Free device memory

* Write the CUDA kernel

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is
demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.

#### Suggestions

* Develop your application incrementally

* Do not modify the template code written -- only insert code where the `//@@` demarcation is placed

* Make sure to test your results against all the datasets provided

* Do not wait until the last minute to attempt the lab.

* Make sure that you test your program using all the datasets provided (the datasets can be selected using the dropdown next to the submission button)

* Even though you can submit multiple times, only your last submission is graded.
