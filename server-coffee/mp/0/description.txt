### MP0: Initial Lab Tour with Device Query

#### Objective

The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with using the submission system for this course and the hardware used.

#### Instructions

Click on the code tab and then read the code written.
Do not worry if you do not understand all the details of the code (the purpose is to get you familiar with the submission system).
Once done reading, click the submit button.

The submission system will automatically switch to the analysis tab, and you will see the following information under the `Logger` section.

The `Logger` section has 3 columns:

* *Level* is the level specified when calling the `wbLog` function (indicating the severity of the event),
* *Location* describes the `function::line_number` of the `wbLog` call, and
* *Message* which is the message specified for the `wbLog` function


We log the hardware information used for this course --- the details which will be explained in the first few lectures.

* GPU card's name

* GPU computation capabilities

* Maximum number of block dimensions

* Maximum number of grid dimensions

* Maximum size of GPU memory

* Amount of constant and share memory

* Warp size

The second section in the Analysis tab is the Attempts section, which lists past submissions to the system.
Note that even though you can submit multiple times, only your last submission is graded.

After completing this lab, and before proceeding to the next one, you will find it helpful to visit the [help](/help) document.
