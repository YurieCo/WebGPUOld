# Lab Parallel Programming for Coursera

## Current Features

* Login/Signup system

* Scheduling system

* Grading system

* Deployment to AWS tested

## Demo

## Progress

* Only thing missing is some tweaks to the interface

* Should be ready in time for the course, but we probably need
to monitor it closely for the first lab.

## Things Needed

* Maybe the looking at why it does not work on IE --- do not know much about IE

* Setup ports/permissions on an AMI image (by email) or offline --- bad idea to have root privilages for the running C code

* Integrate the signup system with coursera --- just give them a code that would make us identify who they are in the coursera system. We do not need to expose the coursera login system --- unless we have to.

## By-product

* With a few lines of code, this can be changed from a GPU computation lab framework to a CPU lab framework --- only need to update the compile command.
